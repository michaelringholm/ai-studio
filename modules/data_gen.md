# Text used with GenAI for data gen
Write code to generate synthetic dataset to use for AI training purposes. Save it to a CSV file as utf-8 with header row. The target column is fav_animal (the column we later will predict). The rest are features, name accordingly and put target col at the end. Use the following logic. If people are male, right handed and above 30 they like dogs. If below thirty cats. If they are female, right handed, and above 30 tigers, if below then bunnies. If male, left handed above 50 then elephants, if below then giraffes. Create another method that takes re-reads the CSV as input, puts it in a pandas df and normalizes and scales the data for AI training using (Keras model.fit()), then saves that file as a new utf-8 csv file. Keep the target_col also in the second file.
